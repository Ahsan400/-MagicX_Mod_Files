## Microsoft Store
Since I removed all installed apps there are a possibility that you might use apps that I removed. With ms store you can easily install it again. If you really don't like MS Store that you can Uninstall it from any app uninstaller. Though I recommend you to use Iobit Uninstaller that has been added to **MagicX Toolbox > Download Center**.

## Photos
There are some people who would like to use Windows 10 Photos app rather than older Windows Photo Viewer. But If you are not one of them and want to uninstall it than you can Uninstall it from any app uninstaller. Though I recommend you to use Iobit Uninstaller that has been added to **MagicX Toolbox > Download Center**.

## Snip & Sketch
There are some people who used to take screenshot. In Windows 10 1903 Microsoft introduced a new way of taking screenshot with  **Win+Shift+S**  Button. But If you are not one of them and want to Uninstall it than you can Uninstall it without any apps. Just right click on it from start menu you will see Uninstall option.

## Windows Start
Most of the windows 10 user prefer new windows 10 start menu. More importantly it's a system core component. If I removed it windows update would break, so I kept it. If you don't like it there are some program that can remove start menu. Find them on Google and remove it by yourself and install **StartIsback**. If you are not capable of that much you shouldn't of use windows 10 without start menu.

## Windows Search 
Windows Search and Windows Start are related. So everything of Start applies here as well. Although I tweaked Start and Search. So it won't use lots of system resources or make you OS slow that much I can guarantee.

## Windows Update 
Windows Update is really necessary feature. No program comes without bug and flows. Microsoft always find bugs and security hole and fix them with windows update. Still if you don't like to use it you can disable it from **MagicX Toolbox > Windows Update Settings**
